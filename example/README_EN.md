# Data Organization and Meaning

## Workspace Overview

### 1. Core Design Philosophy

`Workspace` is the core data management class in AiEDA, providing a unified working environment and data flow management mechanism. By encapsulating the workspace directory structure, configuration files, tool output paths, and data files, it achieves efficient integration of EDA multi-toolchains and unified data access.

### 2. Main Functions and Architecture

**Core Functional Modules:**
- Workspace creation and initialization
- Design information management
- Unified configuration file management
- Standardization of tool output paths
- Data file path acquisition interface
- Support for multi-tool engine integration

**Architectural Design:**
- The main `Workspace` class is responsible for high-level functional coordination.
- The `PathsTable` inner class handles all path management, defining the paths for various important files, including technology files, result files, analysis reports, vectorized data, etc.
- Various `Parser` implementations handle the reading, writing, and parsing of configuration files.

### 3. Directory Structure Organization

Using `sky130_gcd` as an example, the complete workspace directory structure is as follows:

```
sky130_gcd/
├── analyse/       # Analysis results directory, storing various visual analysis results for the current design.
├── config/        # Configuration file directory, storing config files for multi-tool engines and flow management.
│   ├── flow.json  # Flow configuration file.
│   ├── path.json  # Path configuration file.
│   ├── parameter.json  # Parameter configuration file.
│   ├── workspace.json  # Workspace configuration file.
│   └── iEDA_config/    # Directory for other third-party EDA tool configurations, using iEDA as an example.
├── output/        # Tool output directory, storing output files from multi-tool engines.
│   ├── DREAMPlace/  # DREAMPlace tool output.
│   ├── OpenROAD/    # OpenROAD tool output.
│   └── iEDA/        # iEDA tool output. The current open-source version only integrates iEDA, so it's used as an example.
│       ├── result/   # Raw data (.def/.v).
│       ├── data/     # Point tool output data (e.g., placement logs).
│       ├── feature/  # Stage-specific feature data (.json, .csv).
│       ├── rpt/      # Report data.
│       └── vectors/  # Vectorized base data (.json).
├── report/        # Report directory, for further organization and summarization of analysis results.
└── script/        # Script directory, storing commercial tool scripts.
```

### 4. Detailed Explanation of the `PathsTable` Inner Class

`PathsTable` is an inner class of `Workspace` that uses a property decorator pattern. It encapsulates path generation logic within methods, allowing users to obtain corresponding file paths for subsequent operations. Its main functions include:

- **Top-level Path Management**: Defines the paths for each subdirectory within the workspace directory.
- **Configuration Path Management**: Manages the paths for configuration files like `flow.json`, `path.json`, etc.
- **iEDA Configuration Management**: Manages the configuration file paths for various tools (e.g., floorplan, place, CTS, route).
- **Output Path Management**: Defines the output paths for tools at different stages.
- **Feature and Vector Path Management**: Manages file paths for feature extraction and vector data.

Note: When users need to integrate third-party tools, they can refer to the **iEDA Configuration Management** section to extend the path management.

### 5. Workflow

**Workspace Creation Workflow:**
1. Call the `create_workspace` method.
2. Create the directory structure.
3. Initialize logging.
4. Generate basic configuration files (`flow.json`, `path.json`, etc.).
5. Set design information and technology library paths.

**Data Access Workflow:**
1. Obtain paths through a `Workspace` instance.
2. Read from or write to files at the corresponding paths.
3. All tool engines use a unified interface to access data.

### 6. Key Implementation Mechanisms

**Path Management Mechanism:**
- Dynamically generates paths using property decorators.
- Employs templated path definitions to ensure consistency.
- Supports path isolation for different designs and tools.

**Configuration Management Mechanism:**
- Uses dedicated `Parser` classes to handle different configuration formats.
- Supports reading, writing, and dynamic updating of configurations.
- Implements associated management of configurations and paths.

## Config Overview

### 1. Configuration System Overview

The `config` directory in the Workspace is the core of AiEDA's configuration management. It adopts a hierarchical design, supporting the unified management of configurations for multiple tool engines. Users can configure the execution flow by directly modifying the configuration files or by dynamically changing configuration parameters through the programming interface of the `Workspace` class.

### 2. Top-Level Configuration File Structure

The `config` directory contains four core configuration files and a tool configuration subdirectory:

```
config/
├── flow.json        # Flow configuration file
├── parameter.json   # Parameter configuration file
├── path.json        # Path configuration file
├── workspace.json   # Workspace configuration file
└── iEDA_config/     # Configuration directory for other third-party EDA tools, using iEDA as an example.
```

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Core Configuration Files

#### 3.1 workspace.json - Basic Workspace Information

This file configures the workspace overview and defines its basic attributes:

```json
{
    "workspace": {
        "process_node": "sky130",  # Process node
        "version": "V1",           # Version number
        "project": "gcd",          # Project name
        "design": "gcd",           # Design name
        "task": "run_eda"          # Type of task to be executed
    }
}
```

**Main Function:** Defines the workspace's identification information, providing the basic context for subsequent tool execution.

#### 3.2 flow.json - Flow Configuration

Records and configures the execution sequence and status of the design flow:

```json
{
    "task": "run_eda",
    "flow": [
        {
            "eda_tool": "iEDA",      # EDA tool used
            "step": "floorplan",     # Execution stage
            "state": "success",      # Execution status
            "runtime": "0:0:5"       # Runtime
        },
        // More stages...
    ]
}
```

**Main Functions:** Defines the type of task to be executed, configures the sequence of flow execution stages, records the execution status and time for each stage, and supports the mixed execution of multi-toolchains.

#### 3.3 path.json - File Path Configuration

Configures and records the paths of all necessary files, which is fundamental for the execution of the design flow:

```json
{
    "def_input_path": "./gcd_floorplan.def",      # DEF file path
    "verilog_input_path": "./gcd_floorplan.v",    # Verilog file path (optional)
    "tech_lef_path": "./sky130_fd_sc_hs.tlef",    # Technology LEF file path
    "lef_paths": [...],                           # List of LEF file paths
    "lib_paths": [...],                           # List of library file paths
    "sdc_path": "./gcd.sdc",                      # Timing constraint file path
    "spef_path": "/gcd.spef",                     # SPEF file path
    // Other path configurations...
}
```

**Main Functions:** Centralizes the management of all input and output file paths, supports the configuration of multiple technology libraries and design files, and provides file access paths for tool execution.

#### 3.4 parameter.json - Tool Parameter Configuration

Configures key parameters for each tool stage using a unified naming standard:

```json
{
    "placement_target_density": 0.4,       # Placement target density
    "placement_max_phi_coef": 1.04,        # Parameter for the placement algorithm
    "cts_skew_bound": "0.1",               # CTS skew constraint
    "cts_max_buf_tran": "1.2",             # CTS buffer transition constraint
    // Other parameter configurations...
}
```

**Main Functions:** Provides a unified parameter naming standard across tools, centralizes the management of optimization parameters for each stage, and supports parameter tuning and exploration.

### 4. Third-Party Tool Engine Configuration

#### 4.1 iEDA Configuration File Structure

The iEDA tool engine configuration is stored in the `iEDA_config` subdirectory, which contains configuration files for multiple stages:

```
iEDA_config/
├── flow_config.json              # Flow configuration
├── db_default_config.json        # Database configuration
├── fp_default_config.json        # Floorplanning configuration
├── pnp_default_config.json       # PDN configuration
├── pl_default_config.json        # Placement configuration
├── cts_default_config.json       # CTS configuration
├── to_default_config_drv.json    # Timing optimization (DRV) configuration
├── to_default_config_hold.json   # Timing optimization (Hold) configuration
├── to_default_config_setup.json  # Timing optimization (Setup) configuration
├── rt_default_config.json        # Routing configuration
└── drc_default_config.json       # DRC configuration
```

<!-- TODO: #### 4.2 <Other Tools> Configuration File Structure -->

### 5. Configuration Management Mechanism

#### 5.1 Parser Architecture

AiEDA uses specialized `Parser` classes to handle different types of configuration files, including:

- `WorkspaceParser` - Workspace configuration parsing
- `FlowParser` - Flow configuration parsing
- `PathParser` - Path configuration parsing
- `ParametersParser` - Parameter configuration parsing
- `ConfigIEDADbParser` - iEDA database configuration parsing
- `ConfigIEDAFloorplanParser`, etc. - iEDA stage-specific configuration parsing

Note: When users need to integrate a third-party tool, they can extend the path management by following the example of `ConfigIEDADbParser` and others.

#### 5.2 Configuration Creation Process

In the `Workspace.create_workspace()` method, the configuration file creation process is as follows:
1. Create the directory structure.
2. Initialize configuration objects.
3. Create each configuration file in order:
   - `flow.json`
   - `path.json`
   - `workspace.json`
   - `parameter.json`
   - iEDA stage-specific configuration files

#### 5.3 Configuration Access and Modification Mechanism

Each `Parser` class provides the following core functions:
- `create_json()` - Creates the configuration file.
- `get_db()` - Reads the configuration into a data structure.
- `set_xxx()` - Sets a specific configuration item.
- Supports dynamic reading, writing, and updating.

### 6. Multi-Tool Support Mechanism

AiEDA is designed with a flexible configuration extension mechanism to support various tool engines:

- Unified configuration interface design.
- Isolated management of tool-specific configurations.
- Support for incremental extension of configurations.
- Reserved extension points for future integration of tools like DREAMPlace.

### 7. Configuration Best Practices

- Use the `Workspace` class API to modify configurations instead of editing files directly.
- Use the unified parameter names in `parameter.json` (e.g., placement density, CTS constraints) for cross-tool configuration.


## Output Overview

The `output` directory within the Workspace is AiEDA's centralized directory system for storing and managing all output data from EDA tool runs. This directory uses an organizational structure isolated by tool name, ensuring clear management and access to data in a multi-tool engine environment. The overall architecture and the contents of each subdirectory are detailed below.

### 1. File Structure

The output directory is designed with a hierarchical structure. The top level is organized by EDA tool names, and each tool's directory is further divided into functionally distinct data subdirectories. This design ensures that data generated by different tools are isolated from each other while also facilitating the sharing of necessary intermediate data between tools. AiEDA provides a standardized API through the `Workspace` class to achieve unified access to the data from various tools.

```
output/
├── DREAMPlace/     # Output from the DREAMPlace placement tool
├── OpenROAD/       # Output from the OpenROAD tool
└── iEDA/           # Output from the iEDA tool (detailed structure below)
    ├── data/       # Data from the execution process of point tools
    ├── feature/    # Stage-specific feature data
    ├── result/     # Result data
    ├── rpt/        # Report files
    └── vectors/    # Vectorized data
```

### 2. Detailed Explanation of the iEDA Tool Output Directory

Taking the iEDA tool as an example, its output directory contains five main subsystems:

#### 2.1 result Directory - Result Data

This directory stores the final result files from each stage of the EDA flow, primarily including netlist files (.v) and physical design exchange files (.def), which are compressed with gzip to save space.

- **File Naming Convention**: `{design_name}_{stage_name}.{ext}.gz`
  - `design_name`: The name of the design, e.g., "gcd"
  - `stage_name`: The flow stage, e.g., "floorplan", "place", "CTS", "route"
  - `ext`: The file extension, mainly "def" and "v"

- **List of Main Files**:
  ```
  result/
  ├── gcd_floorplan.def.gz     # Physical design file from the floorplan stage
  ├── gcd_floorplan.v.gz       # Netlist file from the floorplan stage
  ├── gcd_place.def.gz         # Physical design file from the placement stage
  ├── gcd_place.v.gz           # Netlist file from the placement stage
  ├── gcd_CTS.def.gz           # Physical design file from the clock tree synthesis stage
  ├── gcd_CTS.v.gz             # Netlist file from the clock tree synthesis stage
  ├── gcd_route.def.gz         # Physical design file from the routing stage
  └── gcd_route.v.gz           # Netlist file from the routing stage
  ```

#### 2.2 data Directory - Intermediate Processing Data

This directory stores detailed intermediate data generated by the EDA tool during various processing stages, further categorized by flow stage:

- **Main Subdirectories**:
  - `pl/`: Placement stage data
  - `cts/`: Clock Tree Synthesis stage data
  - `rt/`: Routing stage data
  - `drc/`: Design Rule Check data
  - `log/`: Run logs for the design flow

#### 2.3 feature Directory - Feature Data

This directory stores feature information extracted from the design, providing a basis for analysis and optimization. The feature data is divided into different types, reflecting various aspects of the design.

- **File Naming Convention**: `{design_name}_{stage_name}_{feature_type}.json`
  - `feature_type`: The type of feature, including:
    - `summary`: Macro-level design statistics (cell count, pin distribution, etc.)
    - `tool`: Detailed data reported by the tool's internal mechanisms
    - `map`: 2D mapping data (density maps, congestion maps, etc.), performance metric data
    - `drc`: Design Rule Check results

- **2D Feature Maps**:
  - `density_map/`: Density distribution map
  - `egr_congestion_map/`: Early global routing congestion map
  - `margin_map/`: Macro cell margin map
  - `RUDY_map/`: Routing demand distribution map

#### 2.4 vectors Directory - Vectorized Data

This directory is for breaking down complex chip designs into structured, computable data representations, which is the foundation for AI-driven optimization. We refer to this structured data as **Foundation Data**, also known as vectorized data. This structured data is presented in JSON format and saved in the `vectors` directory.

Specifically, AiEDA implements a "Design-to-Vector" methodology on the result files (.def), deconstructing the chip design into layers of logical netlist and geometric layout. The logical netlist can be further broken down into different levels of representation such as nets, paths, and graphs. The geometric layout can be deconstructed into information for individual patches. This deconstructed information is ultimately aggregated into finer-grained representations like wires and polygons. Additionally, AiEDA also performs vectorized representation of technology information, such as routing layers and vias (.lef), which is a "library-to-vector" process.

- **Main Vectorized Data Types**:
  - `tech/`: Technology information vectorization (`tech.json`, `cells.json`)
  - `instances/`: Cell instance information vectorization (`instances.json`)
  - `nets/`: Net information vectorization (`net_i.json`)
  - `patchs/`: Layout region partitioning vectorization (`patch_i.json`)
  - `wire_graph/`: Netlist graph structure vectorization (`timing_wire_graph.json`)
  - `wire_paths/`: Routing path vectorization (`wire_path_i.json`)
  - `instance_graph/`: Cell instance connection graph vectorization (`timing_instance_graph.json`)

**The specific meanings of this vectorized data will be detailed in a dedicated section later in this document.**

#### 2.5 rpt Directory - Report Files

This directory stores various report files generated by AiEDA's `report` module, used for analyzing and verifying design quality.

### 3. Data Flow Mechanism

Within the AiEDA framework, data flows between different tools and stages as follows:

1.  **Input Processing**: Initial data is read from design files (DEF, Verilog, etc.).
2.  **Stage Processing**: Data is processed by each EDA tool stage (floorplan, place, route, etc.).
3.  **Result Generation**: Final result files are generated in the `result` directory.
4.  **Feature Extraction**: Feature data is extracted and saved to the `feature` directory.
5.  **Vectorization Conversion**: The design is converted into vectorized data and stored in the `vectors` directory.
6.  **Analysis and Reporting**: Analysis reports are generated and saved to the `rpt` directory.

### 4. Output Management Best Practices

- **Data Sharing**: Access output data through the Workspace API to avoid direct file manipulation.
- **Performance Optimization**: For the purpose of intuitive data understanding, the vectorized data currently shown (for nets and patches) are in discrete files, meaning one file corresponds to one net or patch. For large-scale data operations, the data can be stored and processed in batches, for example, one file storing a batch of nets or patches (e.g., `net_0_678.json` could store 679 nets in one file). AiEDA supports both the generation and access of discrete files (e.g., `net_0.json`, `net_1.json`, ..., `net_678.json`) and aggregated files (`net_0_678.json`).


## Foundation Data: Net

- **Example File Path**: `example/sky130_gcd/output/iEDA/vectors/nets/net_0.json`
- **Data Generation Mechanism**:
  - The `Vectorization::buildFeature` function is called to invoke `buildLayoutData` and `buildGraphData` to construct the foundational data.
  - `generateFeature` is called to generate net features, including timing features, DRC features, and statistical features.
  - Finally, the data is saved via `_data_manager.saveData`, where Net data is saved to the `nets` directory using the `VecLayoutFileIO::saveJsonNets` method.
  - Batch processing mode is supported; depending on the `batch_mode` parameter, a single file can save one or multiple nets.

## Foundation Data: Path
- **Example File Path**: `"example/sky130_gcd/output/iEDA/vectors/wire_paths/wire_path_1.json"`

- **Data Generation Mechanism**:
  - First, foundational data is built using `buildLayoutData` and `buildGraphData`.
  - The `buildFeatureTiming` method of the `VecFeature` class is called for timing feature extraction.
  - `eval_tp->runVecSTA()` is executed to perform a detailed timing analysis.
  - Specifically, the `reportWirePaths()` function generates detailed path data by traversing paths in the timing graph.
  - Finally, the data is saved in JSON format to the `wire_paths` directory through file I/O operations.

- **Data Structure Example**:
Path data uses a JSON array format, organizing the nodes and delay arcs of a path in chronological order. Each element in the array is a JSON object representing an element in the path (a node or an arc).

  ```json
  [
    {
      "node_0": {
        "Point": "dpath/b_reg/_147_:CLK (sky130_fd_sc_hs__dfxtp_1)",

  - **Feature Extraction**: The `generateFeature()` method is called to create a `VecFeature` object, and `feature.buildFeatureTiming()` generates timing-related features.
  - **Timing Analysis**: The `runVecSTA` method (called on an `InitSTA::getInst()` instance via `eval_tp->runVecSTA()`) performs a detailed timing analysis to calculate key parameters like arrival times and required times for nodes.
  - **Data Saving**: Finally, the `_data_manager.saveData()` method saves the generated Graph data as a JSON file.

- **Data Structure Example**: Graph data is organized in JSON format, using a standard graph data structure to represent the net connection relationships in the chip design.

  1. The `Vectorization::buildFeature` function calls `_data_manager.buildLayoutData` to construct the basic layout data.
  2. After data construction is complete, `_data_manager.saveData` is called to save the data.
  3. During the saving process, the `VecLayoutFileIO::saveJson` method calls the `saveJsonCells` method.
  4. The `saveJsonCells` method retrieves cell data from `_layout->get_cells().get_cell_map()` and saves it to the `cells.json` file.

- **Data Structure Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "cell_num": integer,      // Total number of cell_master units
    "cells": [            // Array of cells
      {
        "id": integer,       // Cell ID
        "name": "string", // Cell name
        "width": integer,    // Cell width
        "height": integer    // Cell height
      },
      // More cell masters...
    ]
  }
  ```
