## Overview

AiEDA is an open-source AI-native Electronic Design Automation (EDA) library that revolutionizes chip design workflows by introducing a unified design-to-vector methodology. Built on the open-source EDA infrastructures, it transforms diverse chip design data into standardized multi-level vector representations through modular engine integration, comprehensive data extraction frameworks, and hierarchical data management. AiEDA bridges traditional EDA tools with modern AI/ML techniques by providing complete physical design flows, programmatic data extraction capabilities, and standardized Python interfaces, establishing an AI-aided design (AAD) paradigm that enables seamless integration between EDA datasets and AI frameworks.

## Data Flow

The AiEDA data flow follows this pattern:

1. **Design Input** → Workspace creation with design files
2. **EDA Processing** → EDA tools process the design through various stages
3. **Data Extraction** → Feature extraction and vectorization from EDA results
4. **AI Analysis** → ML models analyze extracted features
5. **Optimization** → AI-guided parameter optimization and design improvements
6. **Validation** → Results validation and iteration

```

## Build Methods

### Method 1: Local Installation (Python dependencies and aieda library)

1. **Clone the repository with submodules:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AiEDA
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies and AiEDA library:**

   We support multiple Python package managers (conda, uv, etc.). We recommend UV for its efficiency.

   ```bash
   # Use the provided build script (recommended)
   # The script builds the AiEDA library by default
   ./build.sh
   # You can also skip the AiEDA library build using --skip-build 
   # (recommended for development)
   ./build.sh --skip-build

   # Or install manually
   # Install UV
   pip install uv
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # Install aieda using one of the following options:
   # Option 1: Development mode (recommended for development)
   uv pip install -e .
   # Option 2: Regular installation
   uv build
   uv pip install dist/aieda-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

3. **Compile iEDA:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make -j32 ieda_py
   ```
   **Note:** 
   - When compiling iEDA, you need to switch to the AiEDA directory (i.e., ~/AiEDA/), not the iEDA directory (i.e., ~/AiEDA/aieda/third_party/iEDA/).
   - Building ieda_py requires **sudo** privileges to download additional system libraries. 

4. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   uv run python test/test_sky130_gcd.py
   ```

### Method 2: Docker Build (Complete environment with all dependencies)

Docker provides a containerized environment with all dependencies pre-configured, including Python/C++ dependencies, AiEDA library, and source code.

#### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system
- At least 10GB of available disk space (this will be optimized in future versions)

#### Build Steps

1. **Clone the repository with submodules:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AiEDA
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t aieda:latest .
   ```

**Note:** For detailed Docker instructions, refer to the build script and Dockerfile in the repository.

#### GUI in Docker (X11)

To launch the GUI from inside the Docker container, ensure X11 permission on the host and run:

```bash
# On host (enable local docker X11 access)
xhost +local:docker

# Start container with X11 bindings
docker run -it --rm \
  --name aieda_container \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -e XAUTHORITY=/tmp/.Xauthority \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
  -v ~/.Xauthority:/tmp/.Xauthority:rw \
  --network host \
  aieda:latest bash

# Inside container: test GUI
python3 test/test_ieda_gui.py
```

Tip: Use MobaXterm to start visualization since it ships with an X Server.


## Getting Started

# or
uv run python test/test_sky130_gcd.py

## iDATA Dataset

As a key outcome of the AiEDA library, we are proud to introduce **iDATA**, a large-scale, open-source dataset specifically designed to facilitate AI-aided design (AAD) research. The iDATA dataset is generated using AiEDA's design-to-vector methodology and data management capabilities, providing structured, vectorized data for a variety of AI-EDA tasks.

- **Data Source**: The iDATA dataset is derived from 50 real-world chip designs, covering a diverse range of applications including digital signal/image processors (DSP/ISP), peripheral/interface circuits, functional modules, memories, CPUs, GPUs, and SoCs. These designs are sourced from open repositories such as OSCPU, OSCC, OpenLane, ISCAS89, and CHIPS Alliance, as well as internal projects. All designs are synthesized using 28nm technology and processed through complete physical design flows using Innovus, with data extraction performed via iEDA tools.
- **Data Scale and Statistics**: The complete iDATA dataset amounts to 600 GB of structured data (excluding original raw design files). It includes vectorized representations at multiple levels: design-level, net-level, graph-level, path-level, and patch-level. The dataset captures a wide spectrum of design complexities, with cell counts ranging from 135 to 4,816,399, net counts from 125 to 4,728,816, and wire counts from 1,426 to 79,050,737. Detailed statistics are summarized in the table below.
- **Purpose and Availability**: iDATA serves as a ready-to-use resource for researchers to train and validate AI models for tasks such as prediction, generation, and optimization in EDA workflows. **The full dataset will be open-sourced as soon as possible**, providing a foundation for future AI-EDA research.
- **Accessible Data Samples**: To provide a concrete understanding of our data structure, we have included vectorized data samples in our GitHub repository. This data, located at https://github.com/OSCC-Project/AiEDA/tree/master/example/sky130_gcd/output/iEDA/, was generated by running the open-source iEDA toolchain on the gcd netlist. Regarding the full iDATA dataset, its release is a more complex process due to its large size and the need for data anonymization.
